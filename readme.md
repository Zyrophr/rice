# Rice
This repo contains all my dotfiles, used to build my different rices. i didn't do everything, I just used some part of other dotfiles from /r/unixporn, so feel free to steal <3

## My setup

(this is just a sample of what type of rice you can make with those files. If you want to see more examples, just slide to the bottom of this readme !)

- Wm : i3-gaps
- Bars: polybar
- Editor: vim
- Music player: ncmpcpp + mpd
- Visualizer: cava
- Matrix thing : cmatrix
- Task manager : htop
- menu : rofi
- file explorer : ranger
- system info : neofetch

Everything you need is here, even all of my Wallpapers, but you still will have to install the packages.
But be carful, some of them are NSFW haha ;3

## My packages
Here are the packages I installed on my computer.
This repo might contains some of their config file (but not in most case)
- fish (main shell)
- discord-canary (pushed to $PATH on fedora)
- google-chrome-stable (main browser)
- vim (main editor)
- htop (main task manager)
- neofetch
- rofi (main menu)
- ranger (main file explorer)
- ncmpcpp + mpd (main music player)
- i3-gaps + i3lock-color
- python-pywal + feh + imagemagick + python-pip (rice script)
- rxvt-unicode (main terminal)
- polybar 
- light (brightness control, which is, actually, working strangly...)
- otf-overpass & Hack (main fonts)
- xpp (needed on Fedora)
- lightdm with Pantheon greeter
- compton (only used for transparancy and blur)
- w3m
- weechat
- byzanz (recording app)
- cowsay, fortune, lolcat, cava, cmatrix, sl, cliclock, pipes.sh (fun)

I had to search a bit more when I switched to Fedora, because it was way easier on Manjaro haha, but you shouldn't have to many issues.

This is a WIP, I need to make a tutorial on how my setup works, and maybe how to install all this stuff. But you should be able to figure it out by yourself <3
